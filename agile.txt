Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
Sprint Goal: Create a front-end website that interacts with GitHub APIs to organize projects by topic and technology.

Day 1: Sprint Planning

Define user stories based on project features:

As a user, I want to see a list of projects organized by topics.
As a user, I want to filter projects based on technologies.
As a user, I want to view project details from GitHub.
Estimate the effort for each user story (story points).

Prioritize and select user stories for the sprint backlog.

Day 2-3: Setting Up Project Environment

Set up a version control repository (e.g., GitHub) for the project.
Choose a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira) for task tracking.
Set up a local development environment with a code editor and Git.
Day 4-5: Design and UI Prototyping

Design the user interface for the website using wireframes or mockups.
Choose a color scheme and typography that aligns with the project's goals.
Create UI prototypes for key website pages.
Day 6-7: Front-End Development: Layout and Components

Develop the basic layout structure using HTML and CSS.
Create reusable components for project cards, filters, and navigation.
Implement responsive design to ensure the website looks good on different devices.
Day 8-9: Front-End Development: GitHub API Integration

Integrate with the GitHub API to fetch project data.
Implement logic to categorize projects by topics and technologies.
Display fetched project data on the website.
Day 10-11: Filtering and Navigation

Implement filtering options for projects based on topics and technologies.
Create navigation components to allow users to switch between different sections.
Test the filtering and navigation features for usability.
Day 12: UI Polish and Testing

Polish the user interface by refining styles and layout.
Conduct manual testing to ensure all features work as expected.
Identify and fix any visual glitches or user experience issues.
Day 13: Accessibility and Performance Optimization

Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.
Optimize images and assets for faster loading times.
Run performance tests and make necessary optimizations.
Day 14: Sprint Review and Retrospective

Review the completed tasks with the team.
Present the developed website to stakeholders for feedback.
Hold a retrospective meeting to discuss successes and areas for improvement.
End of Sprint:

At the end of this 2-week sprint, you should have a functional 
front-end website that interacts with GitHub APIs to organize projects 
by topic and technology. The website should allow users to filter projects 
and view project details. Use feedback gathered during the sprint review 
and retrospective to improve your project and plan the next sprint.
